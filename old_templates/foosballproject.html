                    <h1> Foosball Data Collection Project </h1>
                    <p> Language: python </p> 
                    <p> Library/ environment: tkinter, pandas </p> 
                    <p> My roommates and I had a foosball table in college. As part of a school project, I collected data from 40 games. The school project didn't go much further, but I wanted to do more. So, I decided to create a program to track our records and other statistics. The more we played, the more features I added. The data is stored in a google sheet and then read into a pandas dataframe when the program runs. Initially, I had a command line interface, but I expanded to using tkinter as the program became more complex. This was my first time using tkinter and pandas so the code is a little messy, but it is an improvement over some of my previous projects and still maintainable. </p>

                Click <a href="https://github.com/cost12/foosball_data"> here </a> to see this project on Github.
                <p> Switching this project over from a tkinter interface to a web interface would be doable but time consuming. It is a project I am considering for the future, but for now I can provide a tkinter app if you are interested to see how the program works. You can click the link below to download it. Unfortunately, it probably only works on windows machines. </p> <br>
                <a href="data/data_visualizer.zip" download> Download version 0.1.0 </a> <br>
                <p> Some notes:<br> Many screens will have you click update or apply more times than you would want.<br> You can scroll in on the graphs, but you can't move around.<br> I like the color orange.<br> The individual tab is new and has limited features.<br> The tournaments tab was mostly abandoned, so may be incomplete/buggy. </p>
